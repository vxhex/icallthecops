# I Call The Cops
Chicago Stupid Hackathon entry.
ICTC is an app to turn your Android phone into a belt buckle to let others know your clubbin' intention.
Using this app, others can easily look at your crotch to tell if they should hit on you or not.
Simply attach your phone to your belt using zip ties or rubber bands.
Tap the phone's displayed text to change your current relationship status.
This lets others know your intentions and consent to flirtting.
Call the cops using your belt buckle if you feel threatened at any time.
If you'd like to use ICTC at places other than the club, it conveniently plays club music for you while the app is active.
